# Recursion

+ Recursive Design Techniques
	- Tail Recursion 

+ Search for an element in an array of elements
	- Tail Recursion 
		Time - O(N) Space - O(N)

	- Tail -> Iteration done by compilers

+ Recursive Sorting Algorithms
	- Selection Sort - Swap the last element with the max element.
	- Bubble Sort - bubbles the max element towards the end.
	- Insertion Sort - keep inserting at the right position. 

+ Recursion and Mathematical Induction
	- Tickets of denomination 4 or 5 can be issued
	- prove that we can atain any denomination greater than 12.
	- 2 ^ N/5
